# Privacy Policy - Gem LinkedIn Shortcuts

Last updated: February 26, 2026

Gem LinkedIn Shortcuts is an internal recruiting workflow extension.

## What data the extension accesses

- LinkedIn profile page context (such as profile URL/handle and visible name) when a user triggers an action.
- User-configured extension settings (shortcuts, backend URL, and optional defaults).
- Action logs generated by extension/backend for troubleshooting.

## What data the extension does not store

- Gem API keys and Ashby API keys are not stored in the extension.
- These keys are stored on your organization's backend service.

## How data is used

Data is used only to execute user-initiated recruiting actions (for example adding a candidate, uploading to Ashby, adding notes/reminders, and opening candidate records).

## Data sharing

- The extension sends requests to your organization's backend endpoint.
- The backend then calls Gem and Ashby APIs as required.
- Data is not sold.

## Data retention

- Local extension logs are stored in browser local storage until cleared or rotated by log limits.
- Backend-side retention is controlled by your organization's backend/logging policy.

## Security

- Backend routes are allowlisted to extension-supported actions.
- Optional backend shared-token validation can be enabled.
- Sensitive fields (token/key/secret/password-like values) are redacted in logs where possible.

## User controls

Users can:
- Enable/disable the extension.
- Change or reset shortcuts and settings.
- Clear local extension logs.

## Contact

For questions about this extension or this policy, contact your internal extension owner/admin.
